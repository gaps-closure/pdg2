rename ir.csv to counts.csv
move PDGNode/Edge counts to counts.csv
make sure all possible types from pdg_instance.mzn are included in counts.csv 
level n - 1 to level n tallies for node and edge
DistinctFunctionSignatures count in counts.csv
DistinctFunctionsUsedAsPointer count in counts.csv
account AB for every node subtype and edge subtype
subsubtype the parameter edges
get information about source level signature via ctags (for struct literals)


when pdg is extended for function pointers:
PDGEdge.ControlDep.Call.Ind = 
- sum over all indirect call site ci:
    the number of functions that match the call signature
    and also have been referenced by a function pointer 
- for each i in DistinctFunctionSignatures:
   functions which match that signature
