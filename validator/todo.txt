[   ] account AB for every node subtype and edge subtype 
    - [   ] only for root parameter nodes 
    - [   ] for all parameter nodes 
[   ] level n - 1 to level n tallies for node and edge
[   ] subsubtype the parameter edges
[   ] get information about source level signature via ctags (for struct literals)


when pdg is extended for function pointers:
PDGEdge.ControlDep.Call.Ind = 
- sum over all indirect call site ci:
    the number of functions that match the call signature
    and also have been referenced by a function pointer 
- for each i in DistinctFunctionSignatures:
   functions which match that signature
